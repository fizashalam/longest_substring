We import necessary libraries
lengthOfLongestSubstring-defines the functon
checking if the string input value is null
maxLength: it calculates the length of the longest substring
left: This variable represents the left pointer.
charIndexMap: This HashMap is used to store the index (position) of each character in the string s.
Start a loop that iterateing through the string from left to right
Then Check if there  already contains the current character by using charIndexMap
Then the length of the current substring is calculated
finally the maxlength is calculted.
