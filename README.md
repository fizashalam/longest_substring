We import necessary libraries..
"lengthOfLongestSubstring"-defines the functon.
Then we do the checking if the string input value is null.
"maxLength"calculates the length of the longest substring.
"left" variable represents the left pointer.
"charIndexMap" HashMap is used to store the index (position) of each character in the string s.
Start a loop that iterateing through the string from left to right..
Then Check if there  already contains the current character by using charIndexMap.
Then the length of the current substring is calculated.
finally the maxlength is calculted.
